        <p class="paragraph1">
            Hello! My name is Matt, my online alias is known as Bert. I'm 21 years old from New Jersey, USA. 
            I started learning to code in early 2020 just as the pandemic started. I originally started off making Discord bots out of Python, but as I dug deeper into the coding rabbit hole, I started to become more versatile. 
            I began messing around with Unity, and learning C#, I want to use these skills to eventually make my own video game, perhaps even pick up an internship as a Junior Game Developer.
